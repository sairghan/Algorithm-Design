# Graph-Problems-Isomorphism-and-Finding-Girth

This is one of my projects from Algorithm Design (INFSCI 2591) course. The projects in this course are relatively hard (many are NPC problems, this is NP-intermediate problem) and are very helpful as well. I have pushed the source code of this project onto Github.

# Graph isomorphism problem
This problem is a special case of the subgraph isomorphism problem. There is actually still a "unsolved problem in computer science":

     Can the graph isomorphism problem be solved in polynomial time?
     
This problem cannot even be solved by those remarkable scientists or mathematicians. I will discuss the very basic solution only - backtracking.

The idea of this problem is to check all edges of two graphs to see whether they are corresponding or not. If graph1 has an edge between vertices A and B, graph2 should also have an edge between some point M and N. And if graph1 doesn't have an edge between A and B, graph2 should also have no edge between corresponding points M and N. That is to say, we should backtrack all points of graph1 and graph2, and then checkEdges().

We use DFS to go through all vertices, using used[] to label a used vertex, and using perm[] to label permutations of the vertices.
 
    bool DFS(int n, int level, int[][] graph1, int[][] graph2, int[] used, int[] perm) {  
    bool result = false;
    if (level == -1) {
        result = checkEdges(n, graph1, graph2);
    } else {
        index i = 0;
        while (i < n && result == false) {
            if (used[i] == false) {
                used[i] = true;
                perm[level] = i;
                result = DFS(n, level - 1, graph1, graph2, used, perm);
            }
            i++;
        }
    }
    return result;
    }
    
 Then use checkEdges() to see whether these two graphs are actually the same or not.
 
     bool checkEdges(int n, int[][] graph1, int[][] graph2) {  
     bool same = true;
     for x = 0 to n - 1 {
        index y = 0;
        while (y > 0 && same == true) {
            if  (graph1[x][y] != graph2[perm[x]][perm[y]]) {
                same = false;
            }
            y++;
        }
      }
      return same;
     }
     
   The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N2*N!), where N is the number of vertices in graph1 and 2.
   
# Girth of Graph G
  
If we build a tree of a graph on a paper, using a random vertex as the root. We can see the smallest cycle straightforwardly. For example, the graph below:

Use 1 as the root, let's build the corresponding small tree.

As we can see above, the hierarchy is very clear, all we need to do is to BFS the tree, and find the node 2, which is the child node of 4 and 6. It is pretty easy to find such a node.

Before we start, we need to think that what data structure is suitable or easier for this task. We can store a vertex with its depth in the node like the pseudocode below.

    class Node {  
       public int vertex, depth;
       public Node(int vertex, int depth) {
        this.vertex = vertex;
        this.depth = depth;
      }
     }
     
In this task, like isomorphism problem, we still need a label[] array to label the used vertices. In Java, you can use ArrayDeque() to do this, or LinkedList() if you want. If you use C++, you can use std::queue<int>. The different names in these languages actually have similar functions, using which language is not a big deal.

Below is the main part of the BFS process.

![Preview](https://github.com/sairghan/Graph-Problems-Isomorphism-and-Finding-Girth/blob/master/img-path/BFS.PNG)            
                 
The time complexity of BFS is O(m + n), where m is the number of edges and n is the number of vertices. But we have an outer loop to try all vertex as the root, while(root < n - 2 && short > 3). So the time complexity is O(n * (m + n)).
